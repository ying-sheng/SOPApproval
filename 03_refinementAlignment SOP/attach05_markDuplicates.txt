INPUT=File					One or more input SAM or BAM files to analyze. Must be coordinate sorted. This option may be specified 0 or more times.
OUTPUT=File					The output file to right marked records to Required.
METRICS_FILE=File				File to write duplication metrics to Required.
COMMENT=String					Comment(s) to include in the output file's header. This option may be specified 0 or more times.
REMOVE_DUPLICATES=Boolean			If true do not write duplicates to the output file instead of writing them with appropriate flags set. Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false}
ASSUME_SORTED=Boolean				If true, assume that the input file is coordinate sorted, even if the header says otherwise. Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false}
MAX_SEQUENCES_FOR_DISK_READ_ENDS_MAP=Integer	This option is obsolete. ReadEnds will always be spilled to disk. Default value: 50000. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.
MAX_FILE_HANDLES_FOR_READ_ENDS_MAP=Integer	Maximum number of file handles to keep open when spilling read ends to disk. Set this number a little lower than the per-process maximum number of file that may be open. This number can be found by executing the 'ulimit -n' command on a Unix system. Default value: 8000. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.
SORTING_COLLECTION_SIZE_RATIO=Double		This number, plus the maximum RAM available to the JVM, determine the memory footprint used by some of the sorting collections. If you are running out of memory, try reducing this number. Default value: 0.25. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.
READ_NAME_REGEX=String	Regular expression that can be used to parse read names in the incoming SAM file. Read names are parsed to extract three variables: tile/region, x coordinate and y coordinate. These values are used to estimate the rate of optical duplication in order to give a more accurate estimated library size. The regular expression should contain three capture groups for the three variables, in order. Default value: [a-zA-Z0-9]+:[0-9]:([0-9]+):([0-9]+):([0-9]+).*. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.
OPTICAL_DUPLICATE_PIXEL_DISTANCE=Integer	The maximum offset between two duplicte clusters in order to consider them optical duplicates. This should usually be set to some fairly small number (e.g. 5-10 pixels) unless using later versions of the Illumina pipeline that multiply pixel values by 10, in which case 50-100 is more normal. Default value: 100. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.
