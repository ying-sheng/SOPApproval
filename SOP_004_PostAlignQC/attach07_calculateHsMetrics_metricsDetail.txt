PCT_TARGET_BASES_100X: The percentage of ALL target bases achieving 100X or greater coverage.
HS_LIBRARY_SIZE: The estimated number of unique molecules in the selected part of the library.
HS_PENALTY_10X: The "hybrid selection penalty" incurred to get 80% of target bases to 10X. This metric should be interpreted as: if I have a design with 10 megabases of target, and want to get 10X coverage I need to sequence until PF_ALIGNED_BASES = 10^7 * 10 * HS_PENALTY_10X.
HS_PENALTY_20X: The "hybrid selection penalty" incurred to get 80% of target bases to 20X. This metric should be interpreted as: if I have a design with 10 megabases of target, and want to get 20X coverage I need to sequence until PF_ALIGNED_BASES = 10^7 * 20 * HS_PENALTY_20X.
HS_PENALTY_30X: The "hybrid selection penalty" incurred to get 80% of target bases to 30X. This metric should be interpreted as: if I have a design with 10 megabases of target, and want to get 30X coverage I need to sequence until PF_ALIGNED_BASES = 10^7 * 30 * HS_PENALTY_30X.
HS_PENALTY_40X: The "hybrid selection penalty" incurred to get 80% of target bases to 40X. This metric should be interpreted as: if I have a design with 10 megabases of target, and want to get 40X coverage I need to sequence until PF_ALIGNED_BASES = 10^7 * 40 * HS_PENALTY_40X.
HS_PENALTY_50X: The "hybrid selection penalty" incurred to get 80% of target bases to 50X. This metric should be interpreted as: if I have a design with 10 megabases of target, and want to get 50X coverage I need to sequence until PF_ALIGNED_BASES = 10^7 * 50 * HS_PENALTY_50X.
HS_PENALTY_100X: The "hybrid selection penalty" incurred to get 80% of target bases to 100X. This metric should be interpreted as: if I have a design with 10 megabases of target, and want to get 100X coverage I need to sequence until PF_ALIGNED_BASES = 10^7 * 100 * HS_PENALTY_100X.
AT_DROPOUT: A measure of how undercovered <= 50% GC regions are relative to the mean. For each GC bin [0..50] we calculate a = % of target territory, and b = % of aligned reads aligned to these targets. AT DROPOUT is then abs(sum(a-b when a-b < 0)). E.g. if the value is 5% this implies that 5% of total reads that should have mapped to GC<=50% regions mapped elsewhere.
GC_DROPOUT: A measure of how undercovered >= 50% GC regions are relative to the mean. For each GC bin [50..100] we calculate a = % of target territory, and b = % of aligned reads aligned to these targets. GC DROPOUT is then abs(sum(a-b when a-b < 0)). E.g. if the value is 5% this implies that 5% of total reads that should have mapped to GC>=50% regions mapped elsewhere.
