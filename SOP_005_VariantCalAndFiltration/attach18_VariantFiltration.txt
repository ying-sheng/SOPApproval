-V,--variant <variant>												Input VCF file
 --mask <mask>                                                     						Input ROD mask
 -o,--out <out>                                                    						      	File to which variants should be written
 -filter,--filterExpression <filterExpression>                     					One or more expression used with INFO fields to filter
 -filterName,--filterName <filterName>                             					Names to use for the list of filters
 -G_filter,--genotypeFilterExpression <genotypeFilterExpression>   			One or more expression used with FORMAT (sample/genotype-level) fields to filter (see wiki docs for more info)
 -G_filterName,--genotypeFilterName <genotypeFilterName>           			Names to use for the list of sample/genotype filters (must be a 1-to-1 mapping); this name is put in the FILTER field for variants that get filtered
 -cluster,--clusterSize <clusterSize>                              			      	     	The number of SNPs which make up a cluster
 -window,--clusterWindowSize <clusterWindowSize>                  				The window size (in bases) in which to evaluate clustered SNPs
 -maskExtend,--maskExtension <maskExtension>                       			How many bases beyond records from a provided 'mask' rod should variants be filtered
 -maskName,--maskName <maskName>                                   			    	The text to put in the FILTER field if a 'mask' rod is provided and overlaps with a variant call
 --missingValuesInExpressionsShouldEvaluateAsFailing               				When evaluating the JEXL expressions, missing values should be considered failing the expression
 --invalidatePreviousFilters                                       				     		Remove previous filters applied to the VCF
