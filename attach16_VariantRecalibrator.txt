 -std,--stdThreshold <stdThreshold>                      			If a variant has annotations more than -std standard deviations away from mean then don't use it for building the Gaussian mixture model.
 -qual,--qualThreshold <qualThreshold>                  			If a known variant has raw QUAL value less than -qual then don't use it for building the Gaussian mixture model.

 -priorCounts,--priorCounts <priorCounts>                			The number of prior counts to use in the variational Bayes algorithm.
 -percentBad,--percentBadVariants <percentBadVariants>   		What percentage of the worst scoring variants to use when building the Gaussian mixture model of bad variants. 0.07 means bottom 7 percent.
 -minNumBad,--minNumBadVariants <minNumBadVariants>        The minimum amount of worst scoring variants to use when building the Gaussian mixture model of bad variants. Will override -percentBad argument if necessary.
 -resource,--resource <resource>                               	       	      	 A list of sites for which to apply a prior probability of being correct but which aren't used by the algorithm

 -ignoreFilter,--ignore_filter <ignore_filter>           			If specified the variant recalibrator will use variants even if the specified filter name is marked in the input VCF file
 -rscriptFile,--rscript_file <rscript_file>              			        The output rscript file generated by the VQSR to aid in visualization of the input data and learned model
