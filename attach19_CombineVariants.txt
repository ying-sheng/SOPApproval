 -V,--variant <variant>													                         Input VCF file
 -o,--out <out>                                                                    								         File to which variants should be written
 -genotypeMergeOptions,--genotypemergeoption <genotypemergeoption>                 			 Determines how we should merge genotype records for samples shared across the ROD files (UNIQUIFY|PRIORITIZE|UNSORTED|REQUIRE_UNIQUE)
 -filteredRecordsMergeType,--filteredrecordsmergetype <filteredrecordsmergetype>   			 Determines how we should handle records seen at the same site in the VCF, but with different FILTER fields (KEEP_IF_ANY_UNFILTERED|KEEP_IF_ALL_UNFILTERED|KEEP_UNCONDITIONAL)
 -priority,--rod_priority_list <rod_priority_list>                                			 	    	   	  	 A comma-separated string describing the priority ordering for the genotypes as far as which record gets emitted
 -printComplexMerges,--printComplexMerges                                          						Print out interesting sites requiring complex compatibility merging
 -filteredAreUncalled,--filteredAreUncalled                                        						      	If true, then filtered VCFs are treated as uncalled, so that filtered set annotations don't appear in the combined VCF
 -minimalVCF,--minimalVCF                                                         							   	If true, then the output VCF will contain no INFO or genotype FORMAT fields
 -setKey,--setKey <setKey>                                                         								Key used in the INFO key=value tag emitted describing which set the combined VCF record came from
 -assumeIdenticalSamples,--assumeIdenticalSamples                                  						If true, assume input VCFs have identical sample sets and disjoint calls
 -minN,--minimumN <minimumN>                                                       						Combine variants and output site only if the variant is present in at least N input files.
 -suppressCommandLineHeader,--suppressCommandLineHeader                           				If true, do not output the header containing the command line used
 -mergeInfoWithMaxAC,--mergeInfoWithMaxAC                                          				   	    	If true, when VCF records overlap the info field is taken from the one with the max AC instead of only taking the fields which are identical across the overlapping records.
